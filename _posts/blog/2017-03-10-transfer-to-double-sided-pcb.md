Transferring to a two layer PCB, and getting the two layers to line up right can be a pain. If its not right, vias, and through hole parts will not line up right.

This is a visual way to match up the layers. All that's needed is a bright light source, and a clean clear glass sheet elevated about the light source. Here I use some white LED's and a glass sheet salvaged from a printer/scanner.
