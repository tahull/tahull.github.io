## Intro
A simple client to test TCP communication to an Ethernet PIC project.

## Software design
### Layout
This project uses Relative and Linear layouts. A single Relative layout could be used, but things get messy when there's more than a few components. Moving one component when there's other components whose position is relative to the moved component will cause undesired movement of those relative components. Renaming a component will break the relative location of other components and the renamed component.

Putting a Layout in another Layout helps manage component placement. Components that are stacked horizontal or vertical can be grouped in LinearLayout within the RelativeLayout.

### Permissions
Only the permissions the App needs should be set. This App needs to be able to open a socket. Check [Manifest.permission](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html) and search socket shows that "INTERNET" permission is the whats needed. This is added in AndroidManifest.xml.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### Open a socket.
A Socket shouldn't be opened on a UI activity, it will need to run on another thread. From the UI activity start a thread. This thread is arbitrarily named ClientThread.

```java
new Thread(new ClientThread()).start();
```

In the ClientThread, open a socket
```java
class ClientThread implements Runnable {
  public void run() {      
  try{
    socket = new Socket(ip, port);

    }catch (UnknownHostException e){
      e.printStackTrace();
    }catch (IOException e){
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```
